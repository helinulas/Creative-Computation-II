# Creative-Computation-II
Creative Computation II Class

This course will have dive deeper into visual programming methodologies. While this course is a basic introduction to visual programming, participants will gain a deeper understanding of the concepts covered. We will explore different types of operators in Touchdesigner, and learn simple data visualization methods to create interactive projects. Participants will gain a deeper knowledge of operators such as CHOPs and TOPs for interaction, and learn how to build custom interfaces. Participants will also learn how to integrate Python scripts and expressions and gain familiarity with 3D(SOPs) operators and methods. The course will also include an introduction to object-oriented programming methodologies. By the end of the course, participants will be equipped with the skills to create interactive projects using Touchdesigner and have an understanding of visual programming concepts.


In this course, we will cover the following:
- How to use Container components to create custom interfaces
- Interactive animation techniques using CHOPs and TOPs
- Introduction to SOPS - Simple data visualisation with (text) instancing
- How to create dynamic textures and text animations based on user input and data input
- How to use DATs for data management and visualization
- Python scripting tools and expressions
- Techniques for creating real-time data-driven animations using instancing
- How to use sensor devices(Leap Motion) for data input in Touchdesigner
